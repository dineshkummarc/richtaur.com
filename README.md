This is the personal website of Matt Hackett, an HTML5 game developer in Silicon Valley, California. The design is dynamically updated based on the weather where I live in Mountain View, CA. If it's night where I live, the website is night; if it's cloudy or foggy, my website is too.

If you're interested in my work please see the [Lost Decade Games blog](http://blog.lostdecadegames.com/).
