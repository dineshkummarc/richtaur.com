My personal single-page site. The design is dynamically updated based on the weather where I live in San Jose, CA. If it's night where I live, the website is night; if it's cloudy or foggy, my website is too.

If you're interested in my work please see the [Lost Decade Games blog](http://blog.lostdecadegames.com/);

## History

Used to be a Wordpress blog (hence some of the weird markup etc.). I've been moving my life to the cloud as much as possible but am still convinced that a personal website is important.
